Welcome to the 3rad_material repository, which contains some files to get you started working with your 3RAD data. 

This directory contains the following:

1. projectname - The projectname directory is mostly just a file structure to help keep you organized. Most of these files are empty, but provide places for you to put your raw sequence reads, demultiplexed files, stacks output, etc. so you can keep track of it. You are welcome to change things around so that your files make sense to you, but the file names currently align with the scripts you will be using, so make sure to edit your scripts too if you do decide to make changes.
Under projectname/scripts, you will find all the scripts you should need to run 3RAD remotely on the computing cluster. Please rename projectname to fit with your project. 

2. 3rad_bioinformatics.pdf - These are instructions for running stacks and performing parameter optimization. This should get you through everything you need to do on the command line (unless you decide to do more) and finishes by saving a vcfR object of your SNP genotype data for you to move on to filtering and data analysis. 

3. 3rad_bioinformatics.Rmd - This is the Rmarkdown file used to generate the instructions. You don't need to care about this. 

4. practicedata - The practice data directory contains the barcode and popmap files for scalloped hammerhead plates 1,2,3, and 4 as well as popmaps for plates 1 and 2 (schh_popmap.txt) and plates 3 and 4 (lib2_popmap.txt). The raw sequence data can be found on Teams.
